      "annotation": "The candidate paper is relevant to the intellectual context of the topic. It directly investigates gender differences in language use, which aligns with the topic of how gender relates to language. The paper provides empirical data on the subject, examining the language use of men and women in a large sample of text files, which could provide valuable insights into the topic.",
      "abstract": "Differences in the ways that men and women use language have long been of interest study discourse. Despite extensive theorizing, actual empirical investigations yet to converge on a coherent picture gender differences language. A significant reason is lack agreement over best way analyze In this research, were examined using standardized categories database 14,000 text files from 70 separate studies. Women used more words related psychological social processes. Men referred object properties impersonal topics. Although these effects largely consistent across different contexts, pattern variation suggests are larger tasks place fewer constraints use."

      "authors": "Luisa Bentivogli, Beatrice Savoldi, Matteo Negri et al.",
      "year": 2020,
      "annotation": "The candidate paper is relevant to the intellectual context of the topic. The paper discusses the challenges machines face when translating from languages without grammatical gender, like English, into gender-marked languages, which directly relates to the topic of how gender relates to language. The paper also explores how biases in training data, which often reflect the asymmetries of natural languages, can impact machine translation. This could provide insights into how gender biases are reflected in language and translation.",
      "abstract": "Translating from languages without productive grammatical gender like English into gender-marked is a well-known difficulty for machines. This also due to the fact that training data on which models are built typically reflect asymmetries of natural languages, bias included. Exclusively fed with textual data, machine translation intrinsically constrained by input sentence does not always contain clues about identity referred human entities. But what happens speech translation, where an audio signal? Can provide additional information reduce bias? We present first thorough investigation in contributing with: i) release benchmark useful future studies, and ii) comparison different technologies (cascade end-to-end) two language directions (English-Italian/French)."

The paper discusses the relationship between gender and language by exploring how language reflects societal attitudes towards women, how women are expected to speak, and how they are spoken of. It also analyzes the differential role of terms marked for sex. This directly relates to the topic of how gender relates to language.",

      "annotation": "Relevant.\n\nThe candidate paper is relevant to the topic as it discusses the relationship between gender and language. It specifically explores how gender is expressed in different languages and how this affects neural machine translation. The paper also mentions that demographic factors such as gender influence word choices and syntactic constructions in language. These points directly relate to the topic of how gender relates to language.",
      "abstract": "Speakers of different languages must attend to and encode strikingly aspects the world in order use their language correctly (Sapir, 1921; Slobin, 1996). One such difference is related way gender expressed a language. Saying \"I am happy\" English, does not any additional knowledge speaker that uttered sentence. However, many other do have grammatical systems so would be encoded. In translate sentence into, say, French, inherent information needs retained/recovered. The same become either \"Je suis heureux\", for male or heureuse\" female one. Apart from morphological agreement, demographic factors (gender, age, etc.) also influence our terms word choices even on level syntactic constructions (Tannen, 1991; Pennebaker et al., 2003). We integrate into NMT systems.
