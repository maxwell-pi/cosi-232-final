      "annotation": "Relevant. \n\nThe candidate paper discusses the situation of under-resourced languages, which can be considered as low-resource languages. It explores the challenge of scaling existing solutions to bring these languages into a high-resource world. Therefore, it is likely to discuss or propose strategies for these low-resource languages, making it relevant to the topic."

      "annotation": "Relevant.\n\nThe candidate paper is relevant to the topic as it discusses the performance of a large language model (ChatGPT) in translating low-resource languages (LRLs). While it does not directly discuss strategies for improving performance in LRLs, it provides valuable insight into the current limitations and challenges faced in this area. This information could be used as a basis for developing strategies to improve performance in low-resource languages."

      "year": 2021,
      "annotation": "The candidate paper is relevant to the intellectual context of the topic. The paper discusses the challenges faced by low-resource languages, particularly Indian languages, in current language models. It then proposes a new strategy, MuRIL, which is a language model specifically built for Indian languages. This strategy involves augmenting monolingual corpora with translated document pairs to provide supervised cross-lingual signals during training. The paper's focus on strategies for improving language model performance for low-resource languages aligns directly with the topic."

      "authors": "Mirko Farina, Andrea Lavazza",
      "year": 2025,
      "annotation": "Relevant.\n\nThe candidate paper is relevant to the topic as it discusses strategies for preserving linguistic diversity and reducing the dominance of English in large language models (LLMs). The paper suggests that governments and international bodies should develop regulations to support linguistic pluralism and protect cultures in the digital sphere. It also discusses the creation and deployment of smaller models specifically adapted to local languages as a strategy to preserve linguistic nuance and reduce reliance on a single standard language. Other strategies mentioned include community-driven data curation, impact assessments of model deployment, and policies to promote open-access partnerships and linguistic sovereignty. These strategies could be applied to low-resource languages to help preserve and potentially revitalize them."

The paper discusses low-resource machine translation, which is a strategy for dealing with low-resource languages. It covers the state of the art in this research area, including techniques that have been evaluated for creating useful translation models when there is little translated data available. This directly relates to the topic of strategies for low-resource languages."
